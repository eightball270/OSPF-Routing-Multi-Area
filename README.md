# OSPF Routing Multi Area
Based on previous projects ([Cisco and MikroTik Dynamic Routing](https://github.com/eightball270/Cisco-and-MikroTik-Dynamic-Routing/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#cisco-and-mikrotik-dynamic-routing), [Basic VLAN and DHCP Server](https://github.com/eightball270/Basic-VLAN-and-DHCP-Server/tree/main#basic-vlan-and-dhcp-server), and [DHCP Relay Configuration](https://github.com/eightball270/DHCP-Relay-Configuration#dhcp-relay-configuration)), this project uses the OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) dynamic routing protocol, which is suitable for large networks due to its support for multiple areas. It also centralizes the DHCP server configuration, allowing clients in each area to automatically receive IP configuration from the nearest router configured with a DHCP relay.

## Technology Used
1. Cisco Packet Tracer v8.2.2
2. GNS3 (MikroTik)

## Requirements
1. 6 or 8 routers*
2. 3 or 4 switches*
3. Client PCs
4. Access Point and Client Wireless devices**

*) according to the number of OSPF routing areas
**) optional if creating a WLAN connection, but can be replaced with a regular LAN (Client PCs)

## Configuration Completed
