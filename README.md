# OSPF Routing Multi Area
Based on previous projects ([Cisco and MikroTik Dynamic Routing](https://github.com/eightball270/Cisco-and-MikroTik-Dynamic-Routing/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#cisco-and-mikrotik-dynamic-routing), [Basic VLAN and DHCP Server](https://github.com/eightball270/Basic-VLAN-and-DHCP-Server/tree/main#basic-vlan-and-dhcp-server), and [DHCP Relay Configuration](https://github.com/eightball270/DHCP-Relay-Configuration#dhcp-relay-configuration)), this project uses the OSPF dynamic routing protocol to apply to large networks because it has multiple areas, and also makes the DHCP server configuration centralized so that several clients from each area gets IP configuration automatically with the nearest router that has been configured DHCP relay.
