# OSPF Routing Multi Area
Based on previous projects ([Cisco and MikroTik Dynamic Routing](https://github.com/eightball270/Cisco-and-MikroTik-Dynamic-Routing/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#cisco-and-mikrotik-dynamic-routing), [Basic VLAN and DHCP Server](https://github.com/eightball270/Basic-VLAN-and-DHCP-Server/tree/main#basic-vlan-and-dhcp-server), and [DHCP Relay Configuration](https://github.com/eightball270/DHCP-Relay-Configuration#dhcp-relay-configuration)), this project uses the OSPF dynamic routing protocol, which is suitable for large networks due to its support for multiple areas. It also centralizes the DHCP server configuration, allowing clients in each area to automatically receive IP configuration from the nearest router configured with a DHCP relay.
